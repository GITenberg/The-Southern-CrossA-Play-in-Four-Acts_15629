<h2>
    ACT I.
</h2>
<p class="exp">
Outside the Stuart home, May, 1864. The large beautiful lawn of a
  typical Southern home. On the left and partly at the back stands the
  house, of colonial build, a wide porch running the entire length of
  the house, with three broad, low steps leading down to the garden.
  Many vines, mostly wisteria, in full bloom, cover the walls and some
  climb around the banisters. The porch has four white pillars reaching
  to the second story. On the right is a green garden bench, and at the
  back may be seen a road leading past the house, a low picket fence
  between many trees; box-bushes and shrubs are near the right. It is
  near twilight of an afternoon in May. On the right and through the
  picket fence a small gate leading to the garden and thence to the
  family graveyard. Over the whole scene there is a half look of decay:
  the grounds are not in order, the bushes are untrimmed, as though
  poverty had come suddenly to its occupants. At rise of curtain Aunt
  Marthy, an old negro mammy of the familiar Southern type, is discovered
  by the gate leading into the garden; in her hands she holds some roses
  and other flowers she has been gathering.
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> 'Clare hit don't seem natural&mdash;it suttenly don't. Dis
hyer place ain't what it was; look at dat fence and at dem bushes!
It's gittin run down, dat's what's the matter; it's gittin run down.
</p>
<p class="mid">
        [Enter Cupid from the gate at back, leading into the lane.
              He is an old negro of about the same age as Marthy.
              His clothes are very old and worn, yet there is a
              pathetic suggestion of neatness in his ragged dress.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> Marthy, is you seen dem chullen?
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>[2]</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> Nor I ain't seen um since lunch. Mars Bev and Miss Fair
don suttenly tek dis place since de war brek out. I hear um say dey
gwine down to de mill.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> How dey go?
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> I hear Miss Fair say she was gwine ter walk, and den Mars
Bev say hit too far for her; dat she got ter ride de mule: and she up an
tell him ef it too far fer her ter walk, she ain't gwine, 'cause it
suttenly too far fer old Jack.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid</b> (indignant). Jack's er good mule yet, ef he is de onliest
one we got lef. Somehow I don't feel exactly rite wid jes dem two hosses
on de place sides dat ole mule; cose he's a good mule yet, onderstan;
but den I can't get used to jes dem three. I often set and study 'bout
dem hosses and wonder whar de is, and ef de soldiers treat um good and
ef dey gits dey feed regular, and ef&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> Ef dey gits de feed regular hit more dan what we does.
Since de soldiers bin comin' what wid de sewin' and de cookin' and
gibin' way, I wonder dat we gits on er tall. Not dat I grudge hit ter
um&mdash;law, no. Wid us got Mars George and dey cousin Mars Carter, and dars
Mars Gorden same as one ob de fambily, to say nothin' ob Old Marster in
de army.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> And dars Mars Bev, most pester his mar to def ter let him
go; but cose dat chile he too young; he ant more'n fou'teen. But den I'm
frade he gwine: fer ef dat chile set his head on er thing, he good es
got it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> Go on wid you! Dat chile ant no mo' gwine in de army dan
what I is. He know hit all but kill Ole Mistis when she let Mars George
and Old Marster go; and den&mdash;(her voice grows soft, she looks over
toward the gate (Right)&mdash;dar's Mars Phil's grave over dar. She ant neber
bin quite de same since dat ambulance wagen turn in at de gate.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> Hits bin more'n two years ago; but sometimes hit 'pears
like hit was only yestidy. (Marthy starts toward the gate). Whar you
gwine wid dem flowers?
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> Deys fer Miss Charlotte; she love ter hab um on de table.
'Pears like hit mek hit sorter brighter fer um.
</p>
<p class="mid">
        [Cupid goes to gate at back and stands looking anxiously off
              down the road (Right).
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> I'm gettin' mighty oneasy 'bout dem chullen. Dey's terbil
careless 'bout demselves.
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy</b> (stops on the steps and listens). 'Pears like I hears a hoss.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>[3]</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> Go on, nigger! Didn't I tell you dey walked to de mill?
</p>
<p class="sdr">
                                               [A horse's hoofs are heard.
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy</b> (laughs). I hears hit all de same.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid</b> (drops hat in astonishment). Hi! ef dey ant not one er my
kerrige hosses! Hi, dar! Mars Bev! Mars Bev!
</p>
<p class="mid">
        [Enter at the back by the road Fair and Bev. She is riding on
              a big brown horse with a bag of meal before her. She is
              a beautiful young girl of about eighteen, simply dressed
              in a pink cotton gown; her hair hangs in loose curls about
              her face: her hat is carried loosely in one hand; with the
              other she is guiding the old horse. Bev walks at her side,
              with one hand on the bridle. He is a very handsome boy of
              about fourteen, with a gay, happy manner. He is barefoot,
              dressed in a soft white cotton shirt and blue homespun
              trousers. He is without hat or coat, and seems in the best
              of spirits. They stop at the gate, laughing.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (from her place on the horse). Take me down, Bev. Here,
Cupid, you take the meal.
</p>
<p class="mid">
        [Cupid comes forward too surprised to speak, lifts down the bag,
              then Bev takes her hands and lifts her to the ground.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> Whar you git dis hoss?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev</b> (laughs and winks at Fair). Why, out of the second stall near
the door. Where'd you think?
</p>
<p class="sdr">
                                                   [Marthy and Fair laugh.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> Dis hoss ant never pack no meal fo' in his life; he's er
kerrige hoss.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> Well, Cupid, we had to get the meal, and Jack is so old and
stiff I thought Tony here would enjoy the trip, and he did, all except
the ferry. I don't believe he ever crossed a stream before, not with me
on his back and a bag of meal. Was'nt he funny, Bev? Dear old Tony! (She
throws her arms around his neck). I wish I had some sugar for you.
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> Go'long, child! You talkin' 'bout givin' sugar to dat old
hoss, when we all has to put 'lasses in de coffee and proud ter git hit.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cupid.</b> You tell Mistis and Marster dey's come.
</p>
<p class="sdr">
                             [He leads horse off (Left) carrying the meal.
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> Yo' pa bin askin' 'bout you; he say he gwine way ter morrow.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[4]</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (anxious). To-morrow!
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Where is he?
</p>
<p>
<b>Marthy.</b> He an' you ma done gone for walk round de quarters.
</p>
<p class="sdr">
                                              [Exit Marthy into the house.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Fair, did you know father was going back to his regiment
to-morrow?
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> I was afraid of it. The wound is almost healed, but mother
can't bear to have us mention his leaving us again.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Why, I had hoped to go back with him; I hate to be young.
Why, Fair, do you know sometimes I feel so crazy to go off with the army
I believe I'll run away, except&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> Yes, I know; you mean mother. When father and George are
gone, we're all she's got.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> I wish I'd been twins; then one of me could go.
</p>
<p class="sdr">
                                                             [Fair laughs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> But if you had been, 'twould be just twice as hard for us
to give you up.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> I say, let's go find father. They're walking in the lane
down past the quarters.
</p>
<p class="sdr">
                                                          [Fair hesitates.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> You go, Bev; I'll meet you near the gate. (She smiles at
him). I'm tired, I reckon.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev</b> (slightly disappointed). I won't go unless you come.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (sits quietly for a moment, then looks up quickly at him).
Go on, Bev, don't mind if I stay here. (A slight pause). Was there any
news to-day?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Nothing new. But won't it be splendid if General Morgan
brings his camp near enough for George and Carter and Gordon all to come
by and see us. Gee! I wish they'd come.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> Oh, Bev, do you think they could? 'Twould seem too good to
be true. (She is silent for a moment). Bev, did you know Stephen
Winthrop and his command had been ordered to the South? Doesn't it seem
strange for a man with Southern blood to fight against his people? Of
course he is our cousin, and that ought to make some difference, and
then he was raised in the North with only visits here. And I suppose&mdash;I
suppose its natural, but then&mdash;I wish&mdash;Oh, I wish it were different.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> I don't feel like he was our cousin any more. Didn't it seem
strange that he and Mr. Hopkins should have visited here just before the
war? I liked them fine. I believe I liked Hopkins best. I was awful
sorry when they went away.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (quietly, without looking at him). Does that seem very long
ago to you, Bev?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev</b> (surprised). Why, no: not longer than it was.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>[5]</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> I was thinking&mdash;I can't help wondering if we shall ever see
him again.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Who do you mean, Hopkins?
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (softly). No; Steve!
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> We may, though I hope not.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (surprised). Why?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> He'd be our enemy now.
</p>
<p class="sdr">
                                             [Fair seems greatly troubled.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> Somehow I can't help thinking that we shall see him again.
I often wonder if he's changed. He seemed so different from our boys&mdash;so
very different, somehow.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> I wonder why you never like to walk down through the lane
any more? I don't believe you've been down there for a long time, not
since Hopkins and Winthrop were here.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (quickly). Oh, yes, I have, lots of times. When Aunt Sally
was sick and when Uncle Joe died, don't you remember?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> So you have; but I was thinking of the last walk we took
down there. Hopkins and I went off through the woods hunting, and you
and Winthrop walked down to the bars and waited for us. 'Twas night when
we got back, and you and he were still standing near the bars. The moon
made you look so white, I was afraid you were sick. That's why I
remember.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (with an effort). Don't let's talk about that any more, will
you, Bev?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Of course; I didn't know you minded. Was that why you didn't
want to walk there just now?
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (rising). Let's go and look for Charlotte: perhaps she's
heard some news.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> I reckon she's in the house; I'll call her.
</p>
<p class="mid">
        [He runs towards the house, calling "Charlotte! Charlotte!"
              Exit into house.
</p>
<p>
Fair (sits quietly on the bench looking off before her, greatly
troubled). I couldn't, someway I couldn't go there&mdash;to-day. Two years
ago this night! And yet how long, how terribly long ago it seems! He
told me he'd come back. I often wonder why I care: but it was such a
happy time!
</p>
<p class="mid">
        [Her head sinks wearily down on her arm on the back of the bench,
              covering her face.
</p>
<p class="mid">
        [Enter from the back Col. and Mrs. Stuart. Col. Stuart is a
              large, handsome, soldierly man of about fifty the typical
              Southern Colonel. He wears his uniform and walks with a
              slight limp. Mrs. Stuart is a pretty, dignified,
              matronly-looking woman, same few years

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>[6]</span>

              younger than
              her husband. She is dressed in a simple black dress of
              good material, that has evidently seen better days. Fair
              rises quickly, going to them. She places a chair for her
              father, who sits.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (slipping one arm around his neck and pressing her cheek to
his). Dear father, Bev and I were just coming to look for you.

<p>

</p>
<p>

And if you could have seen old Cupid when we got back; he thought of
course we'd take old Jack.

</p>
<p>
<b>Col. S.</b> Dear little girl, what would we do without you? It's hard
for us to see you do the work meant for the slaves. You go to mill and
help them cook and work and sew; and if you and Charlotte ever grieve or
worry&mdash;why, we don't find it out.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> Oh, you're praising us too much. We girls can't fight; I
sometimes wish we could. But we can work, and when that work's for
General Morgan, there's nothing that's too hard for us to do.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mrs. S.</b> We seem to give so little to the cause; we have so little
left, only our work. That's such a comfort to feel we can do something.
When the fighting's near, and all night long we hear the musketry and
cannon, and when the thought comes that you and George are going to the
front, it seems more than we can bear. I fix a light out there on the
front porch, and wonder how the fighting's going on. Bev always stands
out by the gate and listens for the sound of firing coming near. 'Tis
hard to keep him then, he wants so terribly to fight with you and
George. But through those nights that come so often to us now we have
our work, and all night long we sit and sew and knit and listen. Oh,
then the work's a comfort to feel and know we're doing it for you.
</p>
<p>
<b>Col. S.</b> And we out there, who fight, are called the heroes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> Father, must you go to-morrow? The wound can't quite be
well. Stay for a few more days. Why, I feel as though I'd hardly seen
you for a moment.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mrs. S.</b> (who has quietly taken his hand in both her own during
Fair's last speech). To-morrow, dear, and we should thank God he can go.
But let's think of to-night; to-morrow's not here yet, and we have still
to-night.
</p>
<p>

Charlotte and bring them here.

<p>
<b>Col. S.</b> To-morrow. (A pause). Yes, then I must go. Word came to
us that Morgan's camp was moving on this way, and as we fight in battles
there, so must you here. Perhaps before so very long I'll come again,
and bring the boys home, too. Why, George is Morgan's right hand man.
They say when Morgan wants a man of special courage, he always calls on
George. When you think of all the trust that Morgan puts in him, it
ought to make us glad we have our boy to give him.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mrs. S.</b> Yes, glad; I am glad, Phillip. I'm proud of every way we
help the South. And what of Gordon Cabell and Carter Hillary? Are they
with Morgan, too?
</p>
<p>
<b>Col. S.</b> They're Morgan's scouts. They, with five other men, have
saved the army more than once. They know the roads for miles and miles.
Sometimes they are away for weeks, and then they turn up with some news
that means the life of Morgan's army.

              a young girl of some twenty-two or three years, tall,

              gay mood of Fair and Bev.
</p>
<p>
<b>Charlotte</b> (laughing). So I'm to be told the great secret, am I?
What can it be? A new dress for Fair, or have some of your soldier
friends made you happy with some trophy of the fight. Bev?
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> She came near it, didn't she, Bev? But you couldn't really
guess, not if you tried all night.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Remember you promised not to say a word to any one.
</p>
<p>
<b>Char.</b> I promise. But really I can't wait another minute; do tell
me, quick.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev</b> (who is searching behind a bush near the house). I say, Fair,
where'd you put it? 'Twas here last night.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> I found Cupid digging round that bush and I knew he'd find
it and tell, so I hid it here. (She reaches under the steps, drawing out
a small paper parcel. She unrolls the paper, drawing out the half
finished coat of a boy's uniform. It is made from pale-blue flannel,
very soft, and evidently from some dress of her own. The armlets are
embroidered in red cotton). Here it is. Now guess, Charlotte, before we
tell you?
</p>
<p>
<b>Char.</b> I've seen the cloth before&mdash;the dress you had last winter.
But what&mdash;I don't quite see&mdash;what is it now?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev</b> (who has been trying to contain himself, comes nearer,
speaking in a glad, excited voice). It's my uniform. I'm going to fight
before so very long, and Fair is making it for me.
</p>
<p>
<b>Char</b> (taking the little coat tenderly in her hands). But your
mother, Bev!
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> Oh, we're going to tell her, but not now. She'll let Bev go
when he is needed, and so I am making this to have it ready. It isn't
very nice, I know. You see, I never made a coat before, and the cloth is
old and thin and not the right color; but it's all I have. I wish I had
the finest uniform in the world for Bev, but this will have to do. (Her
voice falters for a second). And&mdash;I'm making it myself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Why, Fair, you know I wouldn't wear any uniform but this,
even if I had a dozen. The buttons are those the boys gave me off their
coats, and the rank on the sleeve is all embroidered. I wouldn't trade
with any of them&mdash;not even General Morgan.
</p>
<p>
<b>Char.</b> (putting her arm around Fair). You precious little Fair,
there's not a better uniform in all the South than this, but can't I
help you with it? I'd love to; may I, dear?
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair.</b> If you'll show me how to put in the sleeve, I'd love it;
but I'd rather do the work all by myself, please. You see, Bev's going
to be such a great, brave soldier in this coat. I'd like to think

<p>
<b>Char.</b> I suppose I needn't ask in whose command you are going? I
know you will say Morgan's. But how about your rank&mdash;will you be just a
private?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Not just a private; though, of course, I'll be that if I can
be nothing else. George told me when all was ready and my mother said I
might, that I could come with him. I'd be one of the scouts, the color
bearer; that's the place I want&mdash;(he grows more and more excited)&mdash;to
hold the flag; to feel it was my own, my very own; to feel and touch and
carry. Do you know, Charlotte, I believe I'd think George most as great
a man as Morgan if he'd take me with him in his company and let me have
the flag.
</p>
<p>
<b>Char.</b> Perhaps he will. I'll speak for you; he loves to do the
things I want; and, yes, I'm sure he'll take you for his color-bearer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Where's father, Fair? I must go tell him now before he goes
away. He'll say that I can go; I know he will. And mother: I'll tell
her, too. Where are they?

</p>
<p>
<b>Char.</b> Oh, Fair, it's hard, hard for us all, and most of all for
you. I sometimes wonder how you can be so brave. We've given Phil, and
now your father and George and Carter and Gordon&mdash;all of them in the
army. Now that Bev wants to go, I don't see how we can bear that.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fair</b> (quietly). I sometimes think of it, and then a great wave of
terror seems to pass over me and leave me frantic at the thought. I feel
as though I must tear things with my hands and scream, and go out too
with them and fight&mdash;just to be near them. And then I feel ashamed to
seem so weak. And then I think about the day they brought Phil's body
home, and how mother didn't shed a tear. She looked so strange and
white, as we walked down through the garden to the grave, I took her
hand; it was like marble! Then she looked down at Bev on one side and at
me close by her on the other, and softly smiled&mdash;smiled as she does when
she is very proud and pleased. She spoke just as we came close by the
grave. We three stood very near to Phil, and as they lifted him, she
spoke: "He was the first, and I have loved him best," and then she
smiled again, and softly drew away her hand and laid it for one moment
on the coffin, as though caressing it. Then bending close down by his
side, she spoke, as though to him: "Well done, my own soldier man! The
heavenly hosts are proud of your enlistment!" (A pause). You wonder then
that I'm ashamed to show my fear of losing Bev?

<b>Bev.</b> And, father, you see it's nearly finished now. Of course,
I'll wait till George has a place for me; but Fair and I just wanted to
be all ready. She did it all herself. (He holds up the coat). And it
fits too, all except one place, and she'll fix that. Oh, father, mother,
you'll let me go&mdash;sometime&mdash;of course, not now&mdash;but when I'm needed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Col. S.</b> You shall go when the right time comes. When George
comes, have your talk with him. First, your duty as a soldier is always
to obey. Do as he says. Ride straight; you can do that already. Shoot
straight; that you can learn. Live straight; that you will do. And last
of all, if need be, boy, die with your face straight to the front.

as I, your mother, know you will, there's one thing more for me to

              much like George in manner. He rushes to Charlotte, who
              throws her arms around his neck. Gordon Cabell is a boy
              of some twenty-five years, with a quiet, serious way about
              him. He stands slightly at the back during the meeting of
              the others. He then comes forward and greets all the people
              in the scene, not forgetting the negroes. All three wear
              Confederate uniforms of different rank, and all are very

I've loved you for so long! It won't be hard to show you how that love
can grow. Why, ever since you were a tiny little girl, I have loved you
and watched over you and taken care of you. Do you remember that day, so
many years ago, when you ran away and walked far down the road to meet
your father? You thought you would surprise him as he came back home
from town. You never thought how far you were from home. You walked and
walked until you were so tired you sat down by the road to wait. It was
growing late, and you were frightened at the darkness coming on, and you
began to cry&mdash;for you were such a little girl, and it was getting very
dark. And then I came along and found you. You thought at first I was a
bear; but when I spoke, you ran right into my arms and kissed me, and
said you were so glad I'd come to take you home. Ever since that day
I've loved you&mdash;loved with all my heart, with all

    ACT II.
</h2>
<p class="exp">
The parlor of the Stuart home. A large room with high ceiling and
  carved doors and mantels. The room, when in order, is beautiful in
  every appointment. The furniture, old mahogany, the hangings and
  ornaments are handsome and in good taste. Now, however, the furniture
  is piled together, as though for moving; the pictures, down from their
  places, stand against the wall; some cut through with sabers. Many of
  the chairs are broken and overturned. A large sofa is against the wall;
  this has been slit open and all the bedding torn out. A table left near
  it, and by the sofa a large fire chair. At the back and near the right
  stands the great cedar chest. It, as well as the other things, was
  carried out by the soldiers in Act I. On the right, a desk with writing
  materials. On the left (back) a door. At back (center) double doors,
  with heavy curtains, leading to the hall where may be seen a large
  "grandfather clock," the face smashed in, as though with an ax. On the
  right, a large bay window with two steps leading up to it, looking out
  on the moonlit garden. It is after dusk, three days later than Act I.
  The curtain rises on an empty stage. There is a dreary half light over
  everything.

</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> We've been hiding in a cane-brake two miles down the
river. Uncle and Gordon are with me; the others went back to Morgan.
As soon as I get to him with the plans of Winthrop's forces, he will
attack. Have you a horse here?
</p>
<p>
<b>Bev.</b> Yes, Tony; you can take him.
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> We thought the enemy had gone on down the river. If
I could get the plans, I was to take them on to Morgan, and they to
follow. Here, take the paper, Charlotte. I must not lose a minute.

be surprised at anything you see. Take this paper. It's simply a decoy.

meant it for a signal?

his surrender; you think it is because I am afraid, and that is why I
gave the paper up to you! A signal, then! If that is so,

done; you are a hero, even though you fail, I throw the curtains back
and tell you, you can search the place: there's no more you can find; he
is the last. And if I take this bowl and crash it at your feet, as I do
now, you think that, too, a signal; and with this candle in my hand (she
snatches up candlestick), instead of lighting you throughout the house,
I rush up to the window here and crash it through the glass, as I do
now, and cry to you: Come on! Come on! You call them all my signals?

    ACT III.
</h2>
<p class="exp">
The prison at Columbus. A large, bare room, built of gray stone.
  At the back and to the left a door with heavy iron bars leading to
  the whitewashed corridor, where a lantern is hanging. A smaller door
  on right leading to another room of the prison. High up in the wall
  (Left) is a window with iron bars across it. At the back are two straw
  mattresses, with old army blankets on them. To the right a pile of
  straw which has evidently served as a bed. On each side of the stage
  there is a rough wooden bench. It is 11 o'clock on the night of May
  22nd. The moon shines brightly in at the window. The prison clock
  slowly strikes the hour as the curtain rises. A soldier dressed in
  a torn white shirt and trousers of Confederate gray, lies asleep on
  the straw. Two soldiers lie stretched on the floor at front of stage
  (Right), two others walking restlessly about, while another is reading
  by the stump of a candle stuck in a bottle.

it if he comes.

his pocket and marks off a checker board on the floor. How's that? He'll

</p>
<p>
<b>First Soldier.</b> Caybel, Cabell, or some such name. Had a close
call, too. Don't know yet he's safe. He didn't let on, but I think he's
a friend of Hillary. Both captured at the same place. Been trying to
talk to him all day, but Old Hill watches pretty close when a new one
comes in (Bill's voice outside, singing a snatch of a song). Watch out!

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> I've tried all day to get a word with you but that warden
watches too close. We're going to get out of this&mdash;You first. Remember,
you have got the information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> All of it. But what's your plan?
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> Before they brought me here I got word with your uncle
and told him where we'd be. 'Twas a shot in the air, but it struck all
right. I told them they would take us to the prison here at Columbus.
Now underneath this floor there is a big drain pipe very near the brick
work and on this night at twelve o'clock, a man sent here by Morgan was
coming up the drain and tunnel up to us (here the prison clock strikes
the half-hour). Ah! The bell! One. The half hour. Now if the man shall
come we can be waiting. This is the room. Ah, if he should fail.
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> Can you save any of the others, shall we tell them?
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> What time does the warden come on his last rounds?
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> Usually about twelve.
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> Twelve. The very hour!
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> He may be late.
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> We'll have to chance it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> How will we know when he comes up the drain?
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> I told your uncle to have him dig until he came to the
brick work, then we can tear up the floor and go down to him.
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> How is it you were captured and not Uncle Phil. I don't
understand?
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> Some carelessness of mine. But that don't matter. We're
going to escape.
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> But it does matter. Tell me how it was. You said you got
word to him at one time and then you said he did not know of your
arrest. Now tell me straight, how were you captured.
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon</b> (on his guard). Why I was scouting around for
information&mdash;They took me&mdash;That was all&mdash;I went too near the camp&mdash;the
moon was bright&mdash;The sentry saw me&mdash;I was not careful.
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter</b> (closer). You told me you were taken in my uncle's home.
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> I ran there to escape. They followed me&mdash;they came in
after me. I had no chance.

disguise. (slowly) I don't believe you.
</p>
<p>
<b>Gordon.</b> What do you mean?
</p>
<p>
<b>Carter.</b> I mean that I'm a fool. And that you are the best and
bravest friend a man ever had in the world. At first I did believe you,
though I did not understand. And now I see too clearly why you lied to
me. (slowly) you gave yourself up to the enemy so they would send you
here with me. Your plan was made before&mdash;not afterwards. You gave your
life into their hands to save me (he comes slowly forward) I am not
worth it. Oh, I am not worth your life.

But it can never be. I think she knows it, poor little girl. And if it
must he, she will then give up her love, as she has many things almost
as dear to her. And now when you are free, I want you to go back
home&mdash;to her. And when at last, if you shall win the dearest thing in
life&mdash;oh, boy, be worthy of her love&mdash;be strong and true! Make up to her

              drawing it partially over him, strikes out candle with

understand why we come here to-night. We came to try and save your life.

spies, but we found no papers on you, and for that reason I could send
you here. Now, Hopkins and I have thought and thought about your
capture: but we cannot understand it, and that is why we come to you.
You've played a part&mdash;a desperate game. You had some motive back of your
surrender, but what we cannot guess. Now, man, I want to help you for
your sake and for the sake of those back there. Go call out Hillary, and
make a clean breast of it all. Tell me your game. Confess, and I will
get you both your liberty.

forgotten that you are speaking to an enlisted soldier of the South.

you'd fail, and then there was a chance to save the hearts of those you
love, even as I love them.

<h2>
    ACT IV.
</h2>
<p class="exp">
The banks of the Aspen River, six months later. A cold, cloud-hung
  afternoon in late November. At the back the river may be seen through
  the trees, now almost stripped of their summer foliage. On both sides
  of the scene are heavy forest trees, mostly pine and cedar. Across the
  stage there winds a narrow and very rough road. It is the scene of
  Winthrop's camp, six months before. On the left a large fir tree, with
  branches low to the ground; on the right, some scrub pine and oak.
  Some traces of the camp are still to be seen; some broken boxes; the
  charred remains of a fire at the right, near front. The sound of the
  wind in the pines at rise. Enter Corporal Evans and Hopkins (Right) by
  the road. They have on their leggings and heavy army overcoats, with
  the collars up.
</p>
<p>
<b>Evans</b> (shivering). Uh! nasty weather. I have always been told
about the sunny South. Good example of it, this!
</p>
<p>
<b>Hopkins.</b> It won't last long, I fancy. The last time I was here
the fall was beautiful; never saw such splendid weather (he looks
around). The old camp again. How much can happen in six months. Remember
the fight here? I hate to think about it. We did well to get off with
our lives.
</p>
<p>
<b>Evans.</b> Most of them didn't. I remember that night just like it
was yesterday; 'twas the very night you got back from Columbus. The moon
had just set behind them hills, and the sentry reported all quiet. I was
just turning in, when down on us like a whirlwind came that rebel,
Morgan. We didn't have a show; 'twas "boots and saddles" quicker than I
ever saw it before.
</p>
<p>
<b>Hop.</b> Their victory all right; more than half our men were killed
or captured, and all through the information that fellow Hillary brought
through when he escaped from prison (he gazes off across the river).
I wonder what's become of them&mdash;the people over there?
</p>
<p>
<b>Evans.</b> Why, ain't you heard a word from them?
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>[53]</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>Hop.</b> No, not since we were here in May. Things look right
different now. Why, all along the way, as we were marching here, I
couldn't help thinking how it was changed; the fences down, the fields
all gone to waste, most of the houses burned, and only here and there
some crazy negro cabin, looking as though it were about to tumble down.
How those poor devils live I don't quite see. Ten or twelve of them in
just one little room; and then to see them run and hide when we pass by,
you'd never think we came down here to free them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Evans.</b> How's Col. Winthrop today? He hasn't seemed the same since
this here fight six months ago. He used to be the life of all the camp,
and now he hardly ever speaks. Seems like he has grieved most to death.
I wonder why? Losing a few men don't often hurt a soldier so.
</p>
<p>
<b>Hop.</b> (again looking off across the river). Perhaps it isn't that.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
